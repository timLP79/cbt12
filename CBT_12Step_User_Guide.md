## Introduction

### What is the CBT 12-Step Assessment System?

The CBT 12-Step Assessment System is a web-based platform designed to guide participants through a structured 12-step Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program. The system facilitates a collaborative therapeutic process where participants complete written assessments, and licensed clinicians review and provide feedback on their work.

### Who Uses This System?

The system serves three distinct user groups:

- **Participants**: Individuals enrolled in the 12-step CBT program who complete assessments
- **Clinicians**: Licensed mental health professionals who review participant work and provide clinical feedback
- **Supervisors**: Administrative staff who manage user accounts and oversee the system

### How It Works

1. Participants log in and complete assessments for their current step
2. Assessments are submitted for clinician review
3. Clinicians review submissions and either approve them or request revisions
4. Once approved, participants advance to the next step
5. The process continues through all 12 steps

**Tips for Success:**

#### Completing and Submitting

1. After answering the final question, you'll be directed to a completion page
2. Your assessment is automatically submitted to your assigned clinician
3. You'll return to your dashboard where status will show **"Pending Clinician Review"**

### After Submission

- You cannot proceed to the next step until your work is reviewed
- Check back periodically or wait for notification from your counselor

### Assessment History

The bottom of your dashboard shows all previously completed assessments:

This history helps you track your progress and review feedback from earlier steps.

### Tips for Participants

- **Read Feedback Carefully**: If revision is requested, make sure you understand and address all concerns

### Clinician Dashboard

Your dashboard shows:

- **Pending Assessments**: Submissions waiting for your review (sorted by submission date)
- **Your Statistics**: Number of participants assigned to you, pending reviews
- **Quick Actions**: Links to review assessments

### Reviewing Assessments

#### Accessing Submitted Assessments

1. From your dashboard, locate the "Pending Assessments" section
2. Click **"Review"** next to the assessment you want to review
3. You'll see the participant's responses to all questions

#### Review Page Layout

The review page displays:

- **Assessment Details**: Step number, title, attempt number, submission date
- **Questions and Responses**: Each question with the participant's answer
- **Review Form**: Where you provide feedback

#### Providing Feedback

For each response, you can:

1. **Add a Comment**: Provide specific feedback on that answer
2. **Mark for Revision**: Check the box if this response needs improvement

#### Making a Decision

At the bottom of the review page:

**Option 1: Approve the Assessment**
1. Select **"Approve"** from the decision dropdown
2. Optionally add overall notes of encouragement
3. Click **"Submit Review"**
4. The participant will be notified and can advance to the next step

**Option 2: Request Revisions**
1. Select **"Needs Revision"** from the decision dropdown
2. **Required**: Provide clear, specific notes explaining:
   - What needs to be improved
   - Why it needs improvement
   - How they can strengthen their responses
3. Click **"Submit Review"**
4. The participant will see your feedback and can submit a revised version

### Managing Your Workload

#### Prioritizing Reviews

- Pending assessments are sorted by submission date (oldest first)
- Participants cannot progress until you review their work
- Aim to review within 24-48 hours when possible

#### Viewing All Assessments

- Click **"View All Assessments"** to see all submissions (not just pending)
- Filter by status (all, pending, approved, needs revision)
- Filter by specific participant

### Best Practices for Clinicians

- **Be Specific**: Vague feedback like "needs more detail" isn't as helpful as "Please expand on what triggered this particular feeling"
- **Be Encouraging**: Acknowledge effort and progress, even when requesting revisions
- **Be Timely**: Prompt reviews help maintain participant engagement
- **Be Consistent**: Use similar standards across all participants
- **Document Concerns**: If you have clinical concerns based on responses, document them in your notes and follow your facility's protocols

2. Click **"Search"**
3. Results will filter to match your search term

#### Filter by Step
1. Use the "Filter by Step" dropdown
2. Select a step number (1-12)
3. Click **"Search"**
4. Only participants on that step will be shown

3. Click **"Search"**
4. Only participants assigned to that clinician will be shown

#### Clear Filters

### Creating a New Participant

1. Click the **"Create New User"** button (top right)
2. Fill in the form:
   - **State ID**: 2-letter state code + 8 digits (must be unique)
   - **First Name**: Participant's legal first name
   - **Last Name**: Participant's legal last name
   - **Password**: Minimum 8 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
   - **Confirm Password**: Re-enter the same password

3. Click **"Create User"**
4. The participant can now log in with their State ID and the password you set

**Important**: Write down or securely transmit the password to the participant and their counselor.

### Editing an Existing Participant

1. Find the participant in the user list (use search if needed)
2. Click the **"Edit"** button next to their name
3. Update any of the following:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Current Step (use cautiously - this overrides their progress)
   - Assigned Clinician
   - Password (leave blank to keep current password)
4. Click **"Update User"**

**Warning**: Changing a participant's current step will affect which assessment they can access. Only do this if you're certain (e.g., correcting an error, manual override).

### Deactivating a Participant

Use this when a participant:
- Completes the program
- Leaves the program
- Transfers to another facility
- Should no longer have access

**To Deactivate:**
1. Find the participant in the user list
2. Click the **"Deactivate"** button next to their name
3. Confirm the action when prompted
4. The user status changes to "Inactive"
5. They can no longer log in

**Note**: Deactivation is a "soft delete" - the participant's data remains in the system for record-keeping, but they cannot access the system.

### Best Practices for Supervisors

- **Double-Check State IDs**: Ensure they're unique and correctly formatted before creating accounts
- **Secure Password Handling**: Use a secure method to transmit passwords to participants
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review active users and deactivate those who are no longer in the program
- **Clinician Balance**: Distribute participants evenly among clinicians when possible
- **Document Changes**: If you manually change a participant's step, document why in your facility records
- **Backup Contact Info**: Keep participant contact information outside the system in case of technical issues

## Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues

#### "Invalid State ID or password"

**Causes:**
- Incorrect State ID format
- Typo in State ID or password
- Account has been deactivated

**Solutions:**
- Verify State ID format: 2 letters + 8 digits (e.g., "TX12345678")
- Check for caps lock - passwords are case-sensitive
- Contact your supervisor if you believe your account should be active

#### "You must complete Step X first"

**Cause:** Attempting to access an assessment for a step you haven't reached yet

**Solution:** Complete your current step first. You must complete steps in order.

#### Assessment Shows "In Progress" But I Want to Start Over

**Cause:** You started an assessment but didn't complete it

**Solution:** You cannot restart an in-progress assessment. Click "Resume Assessment" to continue where you left off. If you need to start completely fresh, contact your clinician or supervisor.
