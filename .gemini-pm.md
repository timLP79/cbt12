# Project Manager Instructions for Gemini

**Project Board:** CBT12 Project (ID: #10)
**Primary User:** timLP79

## Core Philosophy
The GitHub Project Board is the single source of truth for all tasks. `TODO.md` is deprecated for active task tracking and serves only as high-level documentation.

## Board Columns
- **Todo:** Backlog of verified tasks.
- **In Progress:** The single task currently being worked on.
- **Review:** Tasks where code is written but pending final verification/testing.
- **Done:** Fully completed and verified tasks.

## Protocols

### 1. Bug Reporting
- **Analysis:** When the user provides logs or describes an error, analyze the root cause.
- **Creation:** If confirmed as a new bug, create a GitHub Issue:
    - Title: Clear and descriptive.
    - Body: Include the error log/description and file references.
    - Labels: `bug`
    - Assignee: `timLP79`
    - Project: Add to "CBT12 Project" in the "Todo" column.
- **Action:** If the user wants to fix it immediately, move it to "In Progress".

### 2. Feature/Task Execution
- **Selection:** When the user asks "What's next?", check the "Todo" column and suggest the highest priority items (Bugs > High Priority Enhancements).
- **Start:** When a task is selected, move the corresponding card to "In Progress".
- **Completion:** When the task is verified fixed/implemented:
    - Close the GitHub Issue.
    - Move the card to "Done".

### 3. Scrum Rituals
- **Daily Standup:** When asked, summarize:
    - **Done:** Recent commits and items moved to "Done" in the last 24h.
    - **In Progress:** The current active task.
    - **Blockers:** Any open bugs or unresolved errors.
- **Status Report:** When asked, provide a high-level overview of the project health, remaining backlog count, and next major milestones.

## Tooling
- Always use `gh` CLI for issue management.
- Always assign `timLP79` to new issues.
